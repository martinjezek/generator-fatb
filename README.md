# FatB generator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/martinjezek/generator-fatb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/martinjezek/generator-fatb)     

> Yeoman generator for jQuery plugins - it makes it easy to create a new plugin with Grunt tasks for testing and releasing new versions.

## Getting Started

This plugin requires Node.js with Yeoman.

If you haven't used [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html) guide, as it explains how to work with Yeoman as a generator and scaffolding tool. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install generator-fatb -g
```

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```shell
yo fatb
```

Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files.
